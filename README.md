### Description
The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file contains the code for:
1. The implementations for KMP, LCS and Rabin-Karp Algorithms.
2. Plots and analyses of the 3 algorithms.

### Running the code
- **Running the code requires Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.**
- Head to the GitHub repository through the link provided above, and clone the repository on your local machine. All the code is contained within the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.
- Download the dataset. It should be placed in the same directory as the code. The dataset can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alizahidraja/covid19-allresearchpapers-lemmatizedinformation)
- After opening the code in an editor, the dependencies can be installed by running the very first command in the code.
- The code is now ready to run.
